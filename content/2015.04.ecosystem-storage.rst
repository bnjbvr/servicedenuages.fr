.. note::

    This article was translated from French by Julien/Sphinx. We thank him a lot
    for this effort! Note, that at the beginning of this year,
    `he also translated MDN to French <https://medium.com/@Sphinx/mdn-pr%C3%A9sentation-de-la-documentation-javascript-70541cecae54>`_!
    **Big up !**


**tl;dr We have to build a service for tracking payments, and we're hesitatant
to go on with our own solution for storage and synchronization.**

As we wrote in `the previous article (FR) <{filename}/2015.04.service-de-nuages.rst>`_,
we want to build a solution for generic data storage. We reboot `Daybed <http://daybed.readthedocs.org>`_
at Mozilla !

Our goal is simple: allow developers, whether they are from Mozilla or from the whole world,
to easily synchronize and save data associated to a user.


.. _storage-specs:

Here are the aspects of the architecture that seem essential to us:

* The solution must rely on a protocol, not on a particular implementation ;
* Self-hosting of the whole solution must be dead simple ;
* Authentication must be pluggable or decentralized (OAuth2, FxA, Persona) ;
* The server should be able to validate records ;
* An authorization/permissions system must allow collection protection or
  fine-grained records sharing ;
* Conflicts resolution could happen server-side ;
* Clients should be «*offline-first*» ;
* Clients should be able to easily merge/reconciliate data ;
* Clients should be usable in the browser *and* server-side ;
* Every component should be simple and easily substituable.

The first question we were asked was: «*Why don't you rather use PouchDB or Remote Storage?*»


Remote Storage
--------------

Remote Storage is an open standard for user storage. `The specification <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dejong-remotestorage-04>`_
is based on existing and proven standards: Webfinger, OAuth2, CORS and REST.

The API is pretty simple and `prestigious projects are using it
<http://blog.cozycloud.cc/news/2014/08/12/when-unhosted-meets-cozy-cloud/>`_.
There exist several `server implementations <https://github.com/jcoglan/restore>`_
and there is even a `Node squeleton <https://www.npmjs.com/package/remotestorage-server>`_
to build a custom server.

The `remoteStorage.js client <https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/>`_
makes possible the integration of this solution in Web apps. This client is in charge of the «local store»,
caching, syncing and gives users a widget so that they can choose the server
which will receive the data (using Webfinger).

`ludbud <https://github.com/michielbdejong/ludbud>`_, a refined version of
*remoteStorage.js* limits itself to the abstraction of the remote data storage.
At the end, it would be possible to have a single library and to store data
in either a *Remote Storage* server, an *ownCloud* server, or even on the bad guys'
like *Google Drive* or *Dropbox*.


At first sight, the specification seemed to fit with what we want to do:

* The philosophy of the protocol is sound ;
* The ecosystem is well-thought ;
* The political vision fits: give back the control of the data to the users
  (see `unhosted <http://unhosted.org/>`_) ;
* Technical choices are compatible with what we've already started (CORS, REST, OAuth2) ;


However, regarding data manipulation, there are several differences with what we want to do:

* The API seems «files» oriented (folders and documents) and not «data» (collections and records) ;
* There is no record validation following some schema (though `some implementations
  <https://remotestorage.io/doc/code/files/baseclient/types-js.html>`_ of the protocol are actually doing this) ;
* There is no option to sort/filter records regarding their attributes ;
* The permission system `is limited to private/public
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/unhosted/5_NOGq8BPTo>`_ (and
  `the author is going for a git-like model
  <https://github.com/remotestorage/spec/issues/58#issue-27249452>`_) [#]_ ;


To summarize, it would seem that what we want to achieve with the storage of
records is complementary to *Remote Storage*.

If there are some needs about «file oriented» persistence, it would be dull to
reinvent this solution. So there is a great chance that we will integrate
*Remote Storage* some day and that it will become a facet of our solution.


PouchDB
-------

`PouchDB <http://pouchdb.com/>`_ is a Javascript library allowing to manipulate
records locally and synchronize them to a distant database.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var db = new PouchDB('dbname');

    db.put({
     _id: 'dave@gmail.com',
     name: 'David',
     age: 68
    });

    db.replicate.to('http://example.com/mydb');


The project sees some traction and benefits from a lot of contributors. The
ecosystem is rich and adoption by projects `such as Hoodie
<https://github.com/hoodiehq/wip-hoodie-store-on-pouchdb>`_ confirms the tool
pertinence for frontend developers.

*PouchDB* handles a local « store » which persistence is abstract and
`is built on top <http://pouchdb.com/2014/07/25/pouchdb-levels-up.html>`_
of the `LevelDown API <https://github.com/level/levelup#relationship-to-leveldown>`_
to persist data in `any backend <https://github.com/Level/levelup/wiki/Modules#storage-back-ends>`_.

Even if *PouchDB* is mainly done for «*offline-first*» applications, it
can be used inside browsers and on the server side, via Node.


Synchronization
'''''''''''''''

Local data synchronization (or replication) is done on a remote
`CouchDB <http://couchdb.apache.org/>`_.

The `PouchDB Server <https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server>`_ project
implements the CouchDB API in NodeJS. Because *PouchDB* itself is used, we
obtain a service which is behaving like a *CouchDB*, but stores data
anywhere (in a *Redis* or a *PostgreSQL* database for instance).

The synchronisation is complete. In other words, all records that are on
the server will end up being synchronised with the client. It is possible to filter
synchronized collections but `its purpose is not to secure data access
<http://pouchdb.com/2015/04/05/filtered-replication.html>`_.

In order to do so, it is recommanded to create `a database per user
<https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-authentication#some-people-can-read-some-docs-some-people-can-write-those-same-docs>`_.

This isn't necessarily a problem since CouchDB `can handle hundreds of thousands
of databases without any problem
<https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/couchdb-user/201401.mbox/%3C52CEB873.7080404@ironicdesign.com%3E>`_.
However, depending on use cases, clustering and isolation (by role, application,
collection, ...) might not be dealt with easily.


The « Payments » use case
--------------------------

During the next weeks, we will have to setup a prototype that keeps an history
of a user's payments and subscriptions.

The requirements are simple:

* The « Payment » application tracks payments and subscriptions of a user
  for a given application ;
* The « Data » application requests the service to check if a user paid or
  has suscribed ;
* The user requests the service to get a list of all payments/subscriptions
  reltated to her.

The « Payment » application only should have the right to create/modify/delete
records. The two others can only have read-only access to these records.

A given application cannot access to some other application payments and a given user cannot access to some other user's payments.


With RemoteStorage
''''''''''''''''''

.. image:: {filename}/images/remote-love.jpg
    :alt: Remote Love - CC-BY-NC Julie https://www.flickr.com/photos/mamajulie2008/2609549461
    :align: center


The idea of *Remote Storage* is to separate the application from the data that
the user created with the application.

In our use case, the « Payment » app is dealing with the data concerning a user.
However, this data does not directly belong to the user. A user should be able
to delete some records but he/she cannot create or edit some existing payments !

The concept of permissions, limited to private/public is not suitable here.


With PouchDB
''''''''''''

It will be necessary to create a *database* per user in order to separate the
records in a secure way. Only the « Payment » app will be granted full rights
on the different databases.

But this won't be enough.

An app must not see payments from another application so it would also be
necessary to create a database per application.

When a user will need to access payments, it will be mandatory to join every
*database* of every application for this current user. When the marketing
department will want to build stats for all apps, one will have to join hundreds
of thousands of databases.

This doesn't seem appropriate: most of the time, there are only few
payments/subscriptions for a given user. Should we have hundreds of thousands of
databases, each of which will have less than 5 records?

Moreover, the server side of « Payment » is implemented with Python, using a
JavaScript wrapper (as `python-pouchdb
<https://pythonhosted.org/Python-PouchDB/>`_) is not something we thrive for.


A new ecosystem ?
-----------------

.. image:: {filename}/images/wagon-wheel.jpg

It is obvious that *PouchDB* and *Remote Storage* are rich projects with dynamic communities. Therefore, it's reasonable to wonder if one should develop another solution.

When we created the *Reading List* server, we built it with
`Cliquet <http://cliquet.readthedocs.org/>`_. We had a chance to setup `a very simple protocol <http://cliquet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/>`_, strongly inspired by
`Firefox Sync <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Sync>`_, to sync records.

The reason clients for *Reading List* were implemented in few weeks, whether in
JavaScript, Java (Android) or ASM (Firefox addon), is that the «*offline first*»
principle of the service is trivial.


Tradeoffs
'''''''''

Of course, we don't intend to compete with *CouchDB* and are making some
concessions:

* Per default, records collections are isolated by user ;
* There is no history of revisions ;
* There is no diff between each revision ;
* Per default, there is no automatic conflict resolution ;
* There is no stream synchronization.

If we are not mistaken, these tradeoffs exclude the possibility of
implementing `a PouchDB adapter
<https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/lib/adapters/http/http.js#L721-L946>`_ for the HTTP-based synchronisation protocol of *Cliquet*.

Too bad since it would have been a great opportunity to capitalize on the user
experience of *PouchDB* regarding the synchronisation client.

However, we have some interesting features:

* No map-reduce ;
* Partial and/or ordered and/or paginated synchronisation ;
* The client can choose, with headers, to delete the data or to accept the
  server version ;
* A single server is deployed for N apps ;
* Self hosting is dead simple ;
* The client can choose not to use local storage at all ;
* The JavaScript client will have its local store management delegated (we're
  thinking about `LocalForage <https://github.com/mozilla/localForage>`_ or
  `Dexie.js <https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js>`_) ;

And we are complying with `the specs we drew at the beginning of the article
<#article-specs>`_ !


Philosophical arguments
'''''''''''''''''''''''

It's `illusionary to think that we can achieve everything with a single tool
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument>`_.

We have other use cases that seem to fit with *PouchDB* (*no concept of
permission or sharing, JavaScript environment, ...*). We'll take advantage of it
when relevant!

The ecosystem we want to build should adress the use cases that are badly
handled by *PouchDB*. It should be:

* Based on our very simple protocol ;
* Minimalist and with multiple purposes (*like our very French 2CV*) ;
* Naive (*no rocket-science*) ;
* Without magic (*explicit and easy to reimplement from scratch*) ;

`The philosophy and the features of our Python toolkit, Cliquet
<http://cliquet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/rationale.html>`_, will of course be honoured :)

As for *Remote Storage*, whenever we face the need, we will proud to join
this initiative. However, as for now, it seems risky to start by bending the
solution to our own needs.


Practical arguments
'''''''''''''''''''

Before being willingly to deploy a *CouchDB* solution, Mozilla *ops* will ask us
to precisely prove that it's not currently doable with experienced stacks (e.g.
MySQL, Redis, PostgreSQL).

We will also have to guarantee a minimum 5 years lifetime regarding the data. With
*Cliquet*, using the PostgreSQL backend, our data is persisted in `a flat PostgreSQL schema <https://github.com/mozilla-services/cliquet/blob/40aa33/cliquet/storage/postgresql/schema.sql#L14-L28>`_.

This wouldn't be the case with a LevelDown adapter that handles revisions split
in a key-value scheme.

If we based our service on Cliquet, like we did with `Kinto
<http://kinto.readthedocs.org>`_, all the automation work of deploying
(*monitoring, RPM builds, Puppet...*) that was done for *Reading List* will be
completely reusable.

As said before, if we go with another totally new stack, we will have to start
again from scratch, including lapping, profiling, optimizing, all of which has
already been done during the first quarter of this year for Reading List.


Next steps
----------

It's still time to change our strategy :) And we welcome any feedback!
It's always a difficult decision to make... ``</troll call>``

* Twist an existing ecosystem vs build a new custom one ;
* Master the whole system or to integrate our solution ;
* Contribute vs redo ;
* Guide vs follow.

We really seek to join the `no-backend <https://nobackend.org/>`_ initiative.
This first step might lead us to converge in the end! Maybe our service will end
up being compatible with Remote Storage, maybe PouchDB will become more agnostic
regarding the synchronisation protocol...

    :alt: XKCD — Standards https://xkcd.com/927/

Using this new ecosystem for the « Payments » project will allow us to setup a
suitable permission system (*probably built on OAuth scopes*). We are also
looking forward to `capitalizing on our Daybed experience for this project
<http://blog.daybed.io/daybed-revival.html>`_.

We'll also extract some parts of the clients source code that were implemented
for *Reading List* in order to provide a minimalist JavaScript client.

By going this way, we are taking several risks:

* reinventing a wheel we don't know;
* failing to make the *Cliquet* ecosystem a community project ;
* failing to place *Cliquet* in the niche for the use cases that are not
  covered with *PouchDB* :)


As `Giovanni Ornaghi said <http://pouchdb.com/2015/04/05/filtered-replication.html>`_:

    Rolling out your set of webservices, push notifications, or background services
    might give you more control, but at the same time it will force you to engineer,
    write, test, and maintain a whole new ecosystem.

And this ecosystem is precisely the one that *Mozilla Cloud Services* team
is in charge of !


.. [#] The `Sharesome project <https://sharesome.5apps.com/>`_ allows for some
       public sharing of one's resources from one's *Remote Storage*.
